product recommendation engine

when user visits site, pixel fires off a post to our system. product recommendation takes it, builds a sku, and sends the sku off with the user's uuid to the RTDS

inputs:
advertiser_id
sku
time*
uuid
life cycle
IP address

outputs:
uuid: sku pair

this is for ecommerce only, to start.

product recommendation only used when retargeting information is not available

decision tree looks as such:

advertiser_id
business rules? => prospecting/post purchase
